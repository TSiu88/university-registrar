## User Stories
* As a registrar, I want to enter a student, so I can keep track of all students enrolled at this University. I should be able to provide a name and date of enrollment.
* As a registrar, I want to enter a course, so I can keep track of all of the courses the University offers. I should be able to provide a course name and a course number (ex. HIST100).
* As a registrar, I want to be able to assign students to a course, so that teachers know which students are in their course. A course can have many students and a student can take many courses at the same time.
* As a registrar, I want to be able to create departments. A student can be assigned to a department when they declare their major and a course can be assigned to a department when it is created.
* As a registrar, I want to be able to list out all of the courses or all of the students in a particular department, so that I can inform the counselors which departments need more students and which need more courses.
* As a registrar, I want to change a student's file to show that they have completed a course, so that I can see if they need to take the course again.
* As a registrar, I want to list out all of the courses a student has taken, so that I can see if they have met their degree requirements.
<!-- * As a registrar, I want to see how many students have not completed courses in any particular departments, so that I can tell the administration which departments need help. -->
